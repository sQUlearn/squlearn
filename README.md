# sQUlearn 0.2.0

sQUlearn is a novel Python package introducing Quantum Machine Learning (QML) capabilities to 
traditional machine learning pipelines via a *high-level / low-level* design approach. The package
features an array of algorithms including Quantum Support Vector Machines, Quantum Gaussian Processes,
Quantum Kernel Ridge Regression and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), all designed to
seamlessly integrate with scikit-learn. The QNN engine facilitates efficient gradient computation and
automated training with non-linear parametrized circuits. Users can further customize their QNN
models, enhancing flexibility and potential outcomes. sQUlearn's kernel engines are designed to
meet various needs, with fidelity kernels and projected quantum kernels, the latter leveraging
the QNN engine for optimization. A feature map tool allows for efficient layer-wise design
based on strings, encouraging innovation beyond standard implementations. Lastly, backend integration 
with IBM quantum computers is handled with a custom execution engine that optimizes session management
on quantum backends and simulators, ensuring optimal use
of quantum resources and creating an accessible environment for QML experimentation.

## Prerequisites

The package requires **at least Python 3.9**.
