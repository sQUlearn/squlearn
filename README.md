sQUlearn is a user-friendly, NISQ-ready Python library for quantum machine learning (QML), designed for seamless integration with classical machine learning tools like scikit-learn. The library's dual-layer architecture serves both QML researchers and practitioners, enabling efficient prototyping, experimentation, and pipelining. sQUlearn provides a comprehensive toolset that includes both quantum kernel methods and quantum neural networks, along with features like customizable data encoding strategies, automated execution handling, and specialized kernel regularization techniques. By focusing on NISQ-compatibility and end-to-end automation, sQUlearn aims to bridge the gap between current quantum computing capabilities and practical machine learning applications.

sQUlearn offers scikit-learn compatible high-level interfaces for various kernel methods and QNNs. They build on top of the low-level interfaces of the QNN engine and the quantum kernel engine. The executor is used to run experiments on simulated and real backends in the Qiskit environment.
