Using an encoding circuit unitary $U_{\\phi}(x)$, and a parameterized set of gates $U_{{\\theta}}$, a trial state $\\ket{f_{{\\theta}, \\phi}(x)} = U_{{\\theta}} U_{\\phi}(x) \\ket{0}$ is constructed.

Note that sQUlearn's flexibility allows us to not only to stick to this quantum circuit design but to use any of the available circuits (or self-designed) in the library. The derivatives of our ansatz functions are calculated under the hood by sQUlearn and the total loss is obtained.
